[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/feklee/natural-spline-interpolator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/feklee/natural-spline-interpolator)

Introduction
============

This package provides an implementation of *interpolation* and *extrapolation*
by means of [natural cubic splines][1].


Example
=======

Code (`plotPoint` function not included):

    var interpolator = require('natural-spline-interpolator'),
        f = interpolator([[-2, 2], [-1, -0.5], [0, 0.5], [1.5, -1.5]]);

    for (x = -3; x < 3; x += 0.000001) {
        plotPoint(x, f(x));
    }

Result:

![Plot][2]

For bad input, behavior is undefined.


Coding conventions
==================

  * Code needs to validate with JSLint.

  * Comments are in Markdown.

  * Avoid constructors (JS is classless), donâ€™t throw exceptions (not necessary
    in JS).

  * Versioning: major.minor.bug-fix

    Incompatible changes to the API mandate an update of the major version.

    Keep version up to date in:

      + Git tags

      + `package.json`
